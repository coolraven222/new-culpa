                                Shamus is such an eloquent man. He goes straight to the point in his lecture and your
                                note-taking abilities will determine whether you do well on your exams or not. </div>

                            <div class="desc">Shamus was a witty, enthusiastic, well-prepared, and brilliant lecturer.
                                He introduced many theories and ideas that broadened my outlook on the world and made me
                                excited to continue taking classes in the social sciences. My biggest qualm with his
                                teaching style, however, is his lecture pace. He spoke very quickly, and used zero
                                visual aids, so it was incredibly hard to take satisfactory notes. I think that he
                                should have either a) maintained his quick pace but also used a visual aid such as
                                lecture slides, or b) slow down. The only way to take comprehensive notes (which were
                                necessary because we were quizzed on the lectures) was to use a laptop. I hate taking
                                notes on a laptop- it's distracting to both me and the people around me, but I wasn't
                                able to keep up. I missed a lot of the names that were mentioned, and I constantly
                                worried that I was missing major points. Otherwise, Khan was a great professor to
                                experience because he is making strides in the field of sociology and clearly has a
                                passion for sharing his experiences and perspectives. </div>

                            <div class="desc">Just noticed that there's no review for Shamus's methods class, so thought
                                I'd throw one in there. I took Social World with Shamus and thought it was just okay,
                                but his Methods class (taken Spring 2015) was really superb.

                                Shamus does what more teachers should but do not do - assign clear projects with
                                deadlines and then present all the information needed to succeed. If you need help, you
                                can seek it out. If you blow it, he does not care, but you know you had everything you
                                need to succeed and then some. This is a refreshing and quite frankly generous
                                mentality. </div>

                            <div class="desc">Dr. Khan is the man. The Social world is a great course. Not only did I
                                learn a lot in the course but I also became a better writer. The only problem I had in
                                this course was with the TA. Like most large and popular courses your experience, grades
                                and learning yield can live and die on the quality of the TA your are paired with. For
                                the first time in my college career I had to pass/fail a course.

                                Not to toot-my-own-horn, but I've published in peer-reviewed journals and social science
                                publications. However, according to this TA, my reviews were too lengthy and my
                                responses were...to be honest over the TAs head. This TAs grading seemed random and
                                selective. Yet, I didn't want to make waves and thought I'd try to win the TA over with
                                my work...never again! Learn from my mistake, don't sit on my hands when your not
                                receiving an accommodation, or your TA has a chip on his shoulder or whatever the issue.
